- [Getty sued Stability AI](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/getty-images-sues-stability-ai-over-art-generator-ip-violations) - Used 12 million images without permission ($1.7B lawsuit)
- AI companies can't prove where they bought their data
- No way to verify if data is legally obtained
- Data sellers can't prove their data is authentic
